Grab Merchant AI Assistant
An intelligent, chat-based assistant that empowers merchant-partners with real-time business insights, personalized recommendations, and operational alerts. Designed for Southeast Asiaâ€™s dynamic markets, it supports multilingual, colloquial communication and delivers clear, actionable guidance with visual dashboards. Built to drive engagement, fast decisions, and growth.

How It Works
Our solution consists of three key components:

Real-Time Dashboard: A web application that displays up-to-date sales and performance data, helping merchants stay informed and react quickly.

AI Chat Assistant: A RAG-based chatbot powered by the OpenAI API that answers questions, generates insights, and presents data through clear text and visual graphs.

Smart Notifications: Real-time alerts notify merchants when inventory is running low, helping them avoid stockouts and maintain smooth operations.
