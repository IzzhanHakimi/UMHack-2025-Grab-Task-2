# Grab Merchant AI Assistant
An intelligent, chat-based assistant that empowers merchant-partners with real-time business insights, personalized recommendations, and operational alerts. Designed for Southeast Asiaâ€™s dynamic markets, it supports multilingual, colloquial communication and delivers clear, actionable guidance with visual dashboards. Built to drive engagement, fast decisions, and growth.

# How It Works
Our solution consists of three key components:

1. Real-Time Dashboard: A web application that displays up-to-date sales and performance data, helping merchants stay informed and react quickly.

2. AI Chat Assistant: A RAG-based chatbot powered by the OpenAI API that answers questions, generates insights, and presents data through clear text and visual graphs.

3. Smart Notifications: Real-time alerts notify merchants when inventory is running low, helping them avoid stockouts and maintain smooth operations.
